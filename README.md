# üß† PDF Conversational Retrieval App with Chainlit

This project demonstrates a **Conversational Retrieval System** that allows users to upload PDF files and interact with the content using natural language questions. Powered by **LangChain**, **OllamaEmbeddings**, **PyPDF2**, **Chroma**, and **Chainlit**, the app extracts text from PDFs, converts it into chunks, creates a vector store for efficient retrieval, and uses conversational models to answer user questions about the PDF content.
